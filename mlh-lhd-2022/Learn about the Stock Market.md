## What is a stock market?
• Investing in equities is an important investment that we make in order to generate inflation
beating returns. This was the conclusion we drew from the previous chapter. Having said that,
how do we go about investing in equities? Clearly before we dwell further into this topic, it is extremely important to understand the ecosystem in which equities operate.
Just like the way we go to the neighborhood kirana store or a super market to shop for our daily
needs, similarly we go to the stock market to shop (read as transact) for equity investments.
Stock market is where everyone who wants to transact in shares go to. Transact in simple terms
means buying and selling. For all practical purposes, you can’t buy/sell shares of a public company like Infosys without transacting through the stock markets.

* The main purpose of the stock market is to help you facilitate your transactions. So if you are a
buyer of a share, the stock market helps you meet the seller and vice versa.
Now unlike a super market, the stock market does not exist in a brick and mortar form. It exists in
electronic form. You access the market electronically from your computer and go about conducting your transactions (buying and selling of shares).

## What are shares?

Shares are a way to own a part of the company’s value. In proportion to the capital you invest, you can get ownership rights to a certain percentage in the company.  Say you own 2% of the shares being traded in the market, you can say you have 2% ownership in the company.

Hence, shares are units of ownership in the company and its financial assets. Shares are also known as stocks, equity, scrips etc. After purchasing them you will be known as a stockholder or a shareholder of the company.


## Why do companies need shares?

Why does a company need money from the market? As mentioned before, when a company is scaling up, expanding its business etc, it will need more capital. During such times, a company can tap into the share market and offer a certain number of shares based on its market value, which investors can buy.

Investors will be paying the company some money and in return get to be part owners. So when the value of shares rises, the value of shares investors own rises. Investors are however not lending money to the company so they are not creditors. These indeed share market basics for beginners because it is essential to understand why companies need shares at all.

## How do you start trading or investing:

You need to open a Demat and trading account. Most investment platforms and brokers these days provide you with a Demat cum trading account. Trading account is used for just the transactions.; buying and selling. Generally, if you are a trader, you don’t really need to open a Demat account because if you are buying and selling within the same day, a trading account will suffice. Demat account is where your shares are stored in electronic form. Generally takes 2 working days for shares to get dematerialised and transferred to your Demat account. So after that, if you buy or sell your share it gets debited or credited from your account.

## Are there any taxes?

Yes, taxes are applicable to the gains you make from your stock market transactions. A brief of how much you will be taxed is mentioned in the table below.

Long term capital gains are defined as gains you make after holding your shares for a period of 1 year or more and short term capital gains are gains you make when you hold the shares for a period of less than a year.


## Stock Market Participants and the need to regulate them :

The stock market attracts individuals and corporations from diverse backgrounds. Anyone who
transacts in the stock market is called a market participant. The market participant can be classified into various categories. Some of the categories of market participants are as follows:

1.Domestic Retail Participants – These are people like you and me transacting in markets

2.NRI’s and OCI – These are people of Indian origin but based outside India

3.Domestic Institutions – These are large corporate entities based in India. Classic example
would be the LIC of India.

4.Domestic Asset Management Companies (AMC) – Typical participants in this category
would be the mutual fund companies such as SBI Mutual Fund, DSP Black Rock, Fidelity
Investments, HDFC AMC etc.

5.Foreign Institutional Investors – Non Indian corporate entities. These could be foreign
asset management companies, hedge funds and other investors

Now, irrespective of the category of market participant the agenda for everyone is the same – to
make profitable transactions. More bluntly put – to make money.

When money is involved, human emotions in the form of greed and fear run high. One can easily
fall prey to these emotions and get involved in unfair practices. India has its fair share of such
twisted practices, thanks the operations of Harshad Mehta and the like.
Given this, the stock markets need someone who can set the rules of the game (commonly referred to as regulation and compliance) and ensure that people adhere to these regulations and
compliance thereby making the markets a level playing field for everyone.

## The Regulator

In India the stock market regulator is called The Securities and Exchange board of India ofen
referred to as SEBI. The objective of SEBI is to promote the development of stock exchanges, protect the interest of retail investors, regulate the activities of market participants and financial intermediaries. In general SEBI ensures…

1.The stock exchanges (BSE and NSE) conducts its business fairly

2.Stock brokers and sub brokers conduct their business fairly

3.Participants don’t get involved in unfair practices

4.Corporate’s don’t use the markets to unduly benefit themselves (Example – Satyam
Computers)

5.Small retail investors interest are protected

6. Large investors with huge cash pile should not manipulate the markets
 
7.Overall development of markets

## Conclusion
Let's recap what we've learned in this tutorial:

- Stock means ownership. As an owner, you have a claim on the assets and earnings of a company as well as voting rights with your shares.

- Stock is equity, bonds are debt. Bondholders are guaranteed a return on their investment and have a higher claim than shareholders. This is generally why stocks are considered riskier investments and require a higher rate of return.

- You can lose all of your investment with stocks. The flip-side of this is you can make a lot of money if you invest in the right company.

- The two main types of stock are common and preferred. It is also possible for a company to create different classes of stock.

- Stock markets are places where buyers and sellers of stock meet to trade. The NYSE and the Nasdaq are the most important exchanges in the United States.

- Stock prices change according to supply and demand. There are many factors influencing prices, the most important being earnings.

- There is no consensus as to why stock prices move the way they do.

- To buy stocks you can either use a brokerage or a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP).

- Stock tables/quotes actually aren't that hard to read once you know what everything stands for!

- Bulls make money, Bears make money, but Pigs get slaughtered!
